## [1.6.0] — 2026-03-05

### Added
- **F2 expand selection to word boundaries** — press F2 after making a rough
  partial text selection in the source or target pane; the selection automatically
  expands to encompass the complete words at each end (e.g. selecting "et recht"
  becomes "het rechtstreeks")
- **Smart word expansion for term adding** — the Add Term dialog and Quick Add
  Term action now auto-expand partial selections to full word boundaries before
  populating the term pair, so you no longer need pixel-perfect text selection
- **Multiple Write glossaries** — the Write column in Settings now allows checking
  multiple glossaries; new terms are inserted into all Write-checked glossaries at
  once

### Changed
- **Term Picker shortcut** — changed from Ctrl+Shift+G to **Ctrl+Alt+G**
- **Quick Add action renamed** — "Quick add term to glossaries set to 'Read'" →
  "Quick Add Term to Glossary Set to 'Write'" (reflecting its actual behaviour)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate terms in Term Picker** — when the same source term matched at
  multiple positions in a segment (e.g. "cap" appearing twice), it was listed
  multiple times in the picker; matches are now deduplicated and renumbered
  sequentially

---

## [1.5.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Standalone database creation** — "Create New…" button in Settings creates a fresh
  Supervertaler-compatible SQLite database from scratch, so TermLens can function
  independently without Supervertaler installed
- **Glossary management** — "+" and "−" buttons in Settings to create and delete
  individual glossaries inside a database; new glossary dialog collects name, source
  language, and target language
- **TSV import** — bulk import terms from tab-separated files matching Supervertaler's
  format (pipe-delimited synonyms, `[!forbidden]` markers, UUID-based duplicate
  detection); flexible header mapping supports multiple column name conventions
- **TSV export** — export all terms from a glossary to the same TSV format, so files
  are fully interchangeable between Supervertaler and TermLens
- **Alt+Down quick-add shortcut** — adds the current source/target text directly to
  the Write glossary (replaces the previous Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T binding)
- **Alt+Up quick-add to project glossary** — new action that adds the current
  source/target text directly to the Project glossary (no dialog)

### Changed
- **Project column is now single-select** — the Project column in Settings uses
  radio-button behavior (only one glossary can be the project glossary at a time),
  matching the single Write glossary pattern
- **Context menu reorganised** — the "Add Term to TermLens" actions are now grouped
  under a separator in the editor context menu, with clearer names ("Add Term to
  TermLens (dialogue)" and "Quick add Term to glossaries set to 'Read'")
- **A+/A− button font sizes** — adjusted for better visual balance (A+ uses 9pt,
  A− uses 7pt instead of both using 7.5pt)

### Fixed
- **Term block text truncation** — TermBlock now recalculates its size when the font
  changes (via `OnFontChanged` override), preventing clipped text after A+/A− resizing

---

## [1.4.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Adjustable font size** — A+ and A− buttons in the TermLens panel header let you
  increase or decrease the font size on the fly while working; also configurable via a
  "Panel font size" control in the Settings dialog; size persists across Trados restarts
- **Dialog size persistence** — the Term Picker dialog remembers its window size and
  column widths between invocations (and across Trados restarts); the Settings dialog
  also remembers its window size

### Changed
- **Subtler expand indicator in Term Picker** — replaced the ► symbol next to source
  terms with a small ▸ triangle in the # column; less visually distracting while still
  indicating which rows have expandable synonyms
- **Double-digit shortcut badges** — numbers 10+ in the TermLens panel now use a
  pill-shaped (rounded rectangle) badge instead of a circle, so double-digit numbers
  are no longer clipped
- **Wider Project column** — increased from 62 px to 72 px in the Settings dialog so
  the "Project" header is no longer truncated

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Alt+digit term insertion** — press Alt+1 through Alt+9 to instantly insert the
  corresponding matched term into the target segment; Alt+0 inserts term 10; for
  segments with 10+ matches, two-digit chords are supported (e.g. Alt+1 then 3
  within 400ms inserts term 13)
- **Term Picker dialog** — press Ctrl+Shift+G to open a modal dialog listing all
  matched terms for the current segment; select by clicking, pressing Enter, or
  typing the term number
- **Synonym expansion in Term Picker** — rows with multiple target translations
  show a ► indicator; press Right arrow to expand and reveal all alternative
  translations, Left arrow to collapse
- **Bulk synonym loading** — target synonyms from the `termbase_synonyms` table are
  now loaded at startup alongside term entries, so the +N badges and Term Picker
  expansion show the correct synonym counts
- **Project glossary column in Settings** — a new "Project" checkbox column in the
  settings dialog lets you mark glossaries as project glossaries; project terms are
  shown in pink, all others in blue (replaces the previous database-driven priority
  colouring which was unreliable)

### Changed
- **Coloring is user-controlled** — pink/blue term colouring is now determined by
  the user's "Project" setting per glossary, not by the database's ranking or
  is_project_termbase fields
- **Wider settings columns** — the Read, Write, and Project checkbox columns in the
  settings dialog are now wide enough for their headers to be fully visible

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Add Term to TermLens** — right-click context menu action in the Trados editor to
  add a new term from the active segment's source and target text; opens a confirmation
  dialog where you can edit the term pair and optionally add a definition before saving
- **Quick add Term to TermLens** — a second context menu action that bypasses the dialog
  and saves the source/target text directly as a new term for faster workflow
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Add Term defaults to Ctrl+Alt+T, Quick Add to
  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T (both reassignable via Trados keyboard shortcut settings)
- **Settings: Read/Write columns** — the termbase list in settings is now a grid with
  separate Read and Write checkboxes; Read controls which termbases are searched,
  Write selects the single termbase that receives new terms (radio-button style)

### Changed
- **ViewPart docks above the editor** — TermLens now opens above the translation grid
  (previously docked at the side) and opens pinned/visible instead of auto-hidden
- **Term badge sizing** — the "+N" synonym count badges on term blocks are no longer
  truncated; width calculations now use ceiling rounding instead of integer truncation

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Renamed project from Termview to TermLens** — all files, namespaces, class names,
  plugin IDs, settings paths, and documentation updated consistently
- **Migrated from System.Data.SQLite to Microsoft.Data.Sqlite** — eliminates the
  `EntryPointNotFoundException` caused by version-fingerprint hash conflicts in Trados
  Studio's plugin environment; uses SQLitePCLRaw with `e_sqlite3.dll` instead of
  `SQLite.Interop.dll`
- Settings path moved from `%LocalAppData%\Termview\` to `%LocalAppData%\TermLens\`
- Updated README with richer description and build instructions

### Technical
- `AppInitializer` now pre-loads `e_sqlite3.dll` by full path via `LoadLibrary` and
  registers `AssemblyResolve` for all managed DLLs we ship (Microsoft.Data.Sqlite,
  SQLitePCLRaw, System.Memory, System.Buffers, etc.)
- `pluginpackage.manifest.xml` Include entries updated to match new dependency set

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-03

First public release.

### Added
- **Word-by-word source segment display** — every word of the active source segment
  is shown in a flowing left-to-right layout, updated as you navigate between segments
- **Terminology highlighting** — words that match a loaded termbase are shown in
  a coloured block (blue for regular terms, pink for project termbases) with the
  target-language translation displayed directly underneath
- **Multi-word term matching** — multi-word entries (e.g. "machine translation") are
  matched and highlighted as a single block, taking priority over single-word matches
- **Click to insert** — clicking a term block inserts the target translation at the
  cursor position in the target segment
- **Termbase settings** — gear button (⚙) in the panel header opens a settings
  dialog for selecting a Supervertaler termbase (`.db`) file; settings are saved to
  `%LocalAppData%\TermLens\settings.json` and the termbase is auto-loaded on startup
- **Auto-detect** — if no termbase is configured, TermLens automatically checks the
  default Supervertaler data directories (`~/Supervertaler_Data/resources/` and
  `%LocalAppData%\Supervertaler/resources/`)
- **Live termbase preview** — the settings dialog shows the termbase name, total
  term count, and source/target language pair after a file is selected

### Technical
- Reads Supervertaler's SQLite termbase format (`supervertaler.db`) directly —
  no separate export step needed
- Docks as a ViewPart below the Trados Studio editor (compatible with Studio 2024 / Studio18)
- Built on .NET Framework 4.8 with strong-name signing (`PublicKeyToken=6afde1272ae2306a`)
- Packaged in OPC format (`.sdlplugin`) as required by the Trados plugin framework
